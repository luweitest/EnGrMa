Input method for STEM

Initially posted on https://sites.google.com/site/luweitest/notes/input-greek-and-mathematical-symbols

In order to input various symbols directly, mainly for mathematical and physical use,  I created an input method several years ago. Based on normal English keyboard, I added all Greek characters, and normal mathematical symbols. The layouts are as follow:
Right Alt or Ctrl+Alt pressed:

Right Alt or Ctrl+Alt pressed with Shift:

Caps pressed:

Caps pressed with Shift:

This method is highly customizable . Using the tool Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator, everyone can design his own keyboard layout. If you wish to modify mine, you could download the source file EnGrMa.klc; Download EnGrMa.7z installation package to use it directly.

It will be installed as an English language keyboard. Switch to it by normal ways as  Ctrl+space, Ctrl+Shift, or clicking the language bar. If you want it to appear under other languages, go to Control panel → Regional and Language Options →  Languages settings or Keybord settings → Text Services and Input Languages. The new installed input method will be listed as "English Greek Mathematical symbols". You can remove it and add it again under other language.

This is an input method only; To display all these symbols, font supporting Unicode should be present, e.g. Lucida Sans Unicode.
